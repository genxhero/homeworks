class Toy < ApplicationRecord
  validates :name, uniqueness: { scope: [:toyable] }
  belongs_to :toyable, polymorphic: true
end

# First, create a
# Toy model and build a polymorphic belongs_to
# association on toyable. Refer to the polymorphic 
# association reading for syntax. Also, you'll
# probably want to handle validation of the toy's uniqueness
# constraint on :name and :toyable (toyable_type and toyable_id
#   in the database). Refer to the Rails documentation for information
#   on uniqueness scope.
#
# Next, build corresponding has_many associations in the Corgi
# and Cat models. These should both be named toys. Again, refer to the
# reading.
#
# Run rails db:seed. Check that your associations work as expected.
